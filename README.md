# UnityPlyImporter
An importer for ply files to Unity projects.
Download the package and add to your project, .ply files will be imported automatically.

This project does not imports color data (might do in future!) so you can create a simple material and just use it as I do in Test/Scenes/SampleScene.

Here is the example of Stanford Bunny imported:
